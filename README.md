Programming Challenge and Data Analysis

- File Generator
  The code generates 4 types of random objects. These objects are :alphabetical strings,
  real numbers, integers, alphanumerics.
  
  The generated file is limited to 10Mb in size.
  
- File Reader
  This puts the generated text by File Generator into Panda Frames. (There's no need for you to do this
  but I prefer to have it sorted into frames). 
  
  An if loop function is then written to print the object type.
